<h2>Task Description: </h2>

<p>In our hospital, there are more and more patients.
  The receptionist used to write down the visits on sticky notes.
  Unfortunately, the sticky notes get lost or taken away by doctors.
  The hospital director thinks that at the beginning a simple program for the receptionist will be sufficient.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>In this stage, your program should:
<ul>
  <li> Show user a menu.</li>
  <li>Create a new appointment.</li><br>
  <ul>
 <li> Ask for the doctor's name.</li>
 <li>Ask for the patient's name.</li>
  <li>Ask for a date.</li></ul><br>
  <li>Print all appointments.</li>
  <li>Delete appointment.</li>
</ul><br></p>
<p> We will use database to store information and retrieve information.
  The following tables “Doctors”, “Patients” and “Appointments” should be created using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
  which is an API for connecting and executing queries on a database and SQL queries.</p>

<p>
<ul> <li> Use DriverManager class  to establish a database connection with the server via its getConnection() method.</li>
 <li> Connection interface represents an established database connection (session) from which we can create statements to execute queries and retrieve results,
   get metadata about the database, close connection, etc.</li>
  <li> Use Statement and PreparedStatement   to execute static SQL query and parameterized SQL query, respectively. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>“Doctors” table should have relationships one to->many “Appointment” table; “Patient” table should have relationships one to many “Appointment” table. Because one doctor can have many appointments as well as one patient can have many appointments to visit doctors.
<br>
  <br>So the algorithm of the stage1:</p>

<ul>
<li>1) Create a database</li>

  <li> 2) Create tables</li></ul>

<p>To create a new appointment:
<ul>
 <li> 1) Check if the doctor name exists in the "doctors" table. If it exists use its id number to create an appointment.
   If not exist Insert doctor name in to “doctor” table and use the id number of the doctor to create anappointment. </li>

  <li> 2) Check if the patient name exists in the "patients" table.
    If it exists use its id number to create an appointment.
    If not exist Insert patient name in to “patient ” table and use the id number of the patient to create an appointment;</li>

  <li> 3) Insert new  appointment  in to “appointment” table</li>
  <br>
</ul>


  Example of SQL query to create “Patients” table:</p>

<p>"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS patients(

idP BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,

patientName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL )";

<ul>

<li>
  To show appointments use SELECT SQL query.</li>
  <li>To delete appointment use DELETE SQL query.</li>
</ul>
